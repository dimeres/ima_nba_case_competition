# ima_nba_case_competition
This project, created for the IMA 2025 Case Competition, presents a data-driven acquisition strategy for the Minnesota Timberwolves, built around a custom performance-to-cost metric. Our recommendations projected an 11.8% boost in win rate, and increased the probability of advancing to the first round of the playoffs from just 0.51% to 52.49%.
